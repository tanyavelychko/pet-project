This is a simple web application created to demonstrate my skills of front-end development in React.js environment.
I also used Material UI components, Redux, Router, Axios and Express.js for back-end. 

User authentication with username and password. On success the app redirects the current user to the calculator page.
In case if there is no such username you will be redirected to sign up page.
The calculator allows you to do some simple math operations. For now, only mouse input is available.

Currently I'm working on keyboard input in calculator as well as adding users database and cookies-based authentication.
